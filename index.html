                    I am a first generation Mexican-American, born and raised in the City of Los Angeles. I graduated
                    from CSULA in Film and Media Studies.
                    I worked in Post-Production for 12 years, my job was to watch MOVIES for a living which was awesome!
                    but then I decided I needed a challenge and wanted to
                    advance in my career. I moved on to work for the Netflix Localization team for their international
                    releases. My job was to make sure we subtiled the movies and shows
                    in its corresponding languages for all regions. Like many COVID-19 shifted my life and I found
                    myself wanting yet another challenge and I now work as a Project Manager
                    for a tech company called Yospace which is based out of the UK. This is why I am now going to UCLA's
                    Coding Bootcamp to better understand how the engineers and project scope all function.

                This is a recent assignment I worked on, where I was tasked
                to clean up the layout and make sure the code was orginized and condenced.
